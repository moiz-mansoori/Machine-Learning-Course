# 🧠 Machine Learning Course - Project Repository

This repository contains all the structured parts of my hands-on journey through a comprehensive **Machine Learning** course. Each part corresponds to a core topic of ML, with related Python code implementations organized in dedicated folders.

---

## ✅ Completed Modules:

### 📁 Part 1 - Data Preprocessing
Contains data cleaning, handling missing values, encoding categorical data, feature scaling, and dataset splitting techniques.  
➡️ Folder includes: `data_preprocessing.py`

---

### 📁 Part 2 - Regressions
Implemented different types of regression techniques:
- **Simple Linear Regression**
- **Multiple Linear Regression**
- **Polynomial Regression**
- **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**
- **Decision Tree Regression (DTR)**
- **Random Forest Regression (RFR)**

---

### 📁 Part 3 - Regression Model Selection in Python
Covers model comparison and selection using all regression models

---

### 📁 Part 4 - Classification
Explored classification algorithms including:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Kernel SVM**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Decision Tree Classifier (DTC)**
- **Random Forest Classifier (RFC)**

---

### 📁 Part 5 - Clustering
Applied unsupervised learning techniques:
- **K-Means Clustering**
- **Hierarchical Clustering**

---

### 📁 Part 6 - Association Rule Learning
Covered market basket analysis with:
- **Apriori Algorithm**
- **Eclat Algorithm**

---

## ⏳ In Progress / Upcoming:

The following parts are available but yet to be explored in-depth:

- 📁 **Part 7:** Reinforcement Learning.  
- 📁 **Part 8:** Natural Language Processing.  
- 📁 **Part 9:** Deep Learning.  
- 📁 **Part 10:** Dimensionality Reduction.  
- 📁 **Part 11:** Model Selection and Boosting.  

---

## 📌 Notes:
- All code is written in **Python** using popular libraries such as `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, etc.
- Files are structured for clarity and modularity to assist in easy reference and revision.
